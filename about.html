<p>We're a couple of gorillas who fight over the best ways to code.</p>

<p>We escaped from a zoo and now we're part of a start up in San Francisco, developing an iOS app (and all the backend node.js mumbo jumbo magick).</p>

<p>We learned our Gorilla Programming methodologies from the <a href="https://www.cs.olemiss.edu/">Univerity of Mississippi.</a> </p>

<p>One of us has a Masters' Degree so he's obviously better. (That's me! 🦍🦍🦍)</p>
